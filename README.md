# Psychic-Game

The application randomly picks a letter and the user guesses which letter the application chose. The following data is shown: 

Wins: # of times the user has guessed the letter correctly
Losses: # of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses
Guesses Left: # of guesses left - this will update
Your Guesses So Far: the specific letters that the user typed - these are displayed until the user either wins or loses

When the user wins, the Wins counter is increased and the game starts over.
When the user loses, the Losses counter is increased and the game starts over.
